<p>
  To save copying and pasting when having repeated content it is easier to use lists.
</p>

<p>
  The "map" function in the gleam/list module is used to transform lists of one kind of thing to another.
  Here we transform a list of fruit names into "li" elements that we use as children to the "ol" element. 
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    ol stands for "ordered list" and li stands for "list item", thus one gets an order list of items in your page.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  Try adding one more item of fruit and updating the page.
